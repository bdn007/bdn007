The Non-Lucrative allows you to reside in Spain without undertaking any economic activity. Applicants must dispose of enough economic means to cover their expenses in Spain. These amount to: â‚¬2.400 for the main applicant and â‚¬600 for each accompanying family member per month. 

If you do not receive these amounts on a monthly basis, it is also possible to show that amount times twelve as a lump sum in a bank account to show that you can cover your expenses in Spain.
